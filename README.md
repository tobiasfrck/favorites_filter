# favorites_filter_vinted

You can easily filter your favorites on Vinted by size, availability and search term and sort by price with this firefox addon.

## Requirements

- Firefox

Chrome version is not available yet but it can be easily ported to Chrome and I will do that probably.

## Features

- Filter by size
- Filter by availability
- Filter by search term
- Sort by price
- Display more/less items per row with Numpad +/-

## Future features

- Better filtering
- Filter by price
- Save and load items (basically load all favorites at once)
- Better UI (maybe)
- Highlight items with certain keywords/brands/sizes (maybe)
